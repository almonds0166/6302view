## Goals

* To be elegant -- just include the library and don't worry about modifying anything.
* To support the following microcontrollers:
   * Teensy
   * ESP32
   * ESP8266
   * Arduino Uno
* To support the following communication methods:
   * Serially (pass in a `HardwareSerial` and BAUD rate)
   * Websockets (pass in SSID and p/w)

## Potentially

* To support the following communication methods:
   * MQTT instead of websockets
   * Bluetooth
